        <p>
          The Academy Awards, popularly known as the Oscars,[1] are awards for
          artistic and technical merit in the film industry. They are regarded
          as one of the most significant and prestigious awards in the
          entertainment industry.[2][3] Given annually by the Academy of Motion
          Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS), the awards are an international
          recognition of excellence in cinematic achievements, as assessed by
          the Academy's voting membership. The various category winners are
          awarded a copy of a golden statuette as a trophy, officially called
          the "Academy Award of Merit", although more commonly referred to by
          its nickname, the "Oscar". The statuette depicts a knight rendered in
          the Art Deco style. The award was originally sculpted by George
          Stanley from a design sketch by Cedric Gibbons.[4] AMPAS first
          presented it in 1929 at a private dinner hosted by Douglas Fairbanks
          in The Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel in what would become known as the 1st
          Academy Awards.[5][6] The Academy Awards ceremony was first broadcast
          by radio in 1930 and was televised for the first time in 1953. It is
          the oldest worldwide entertainment awards ceremony and is now
          televised live worldwide.[7] It is also the oldest of the four major
          annual American entertainment awards; its equivalents – the Emmy
          Awards for television, the Tony Awards for theater, and the Grammy
          Awards for music – are modeled after the Academy Awards.[8] A total of
          3,140 Oscar statuettes have been awarded since its inception in
          1929.[9] They are widely cited as the most famous and prestigious
          competitive awards in the field of entertainment.
