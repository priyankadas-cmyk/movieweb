        Satyajit Ray (Bengali pronunciation: [ˈʃɔtːodʒit ˈrai̯] (About this
        soundlisten); 2 May 1921 – 23 April 1992) was an Indian film director,
        scriptwriter, documentary filmmaker, author, essayist, lyricist,
        magazine editor, illustrator, calligrapher, and music composer. He is
        celebrated for works such as The Apu Trilogy (1955–1959), The Music Room
        (1958), The Big City (1963) and Charulata (1964). Ray was born in
        Calcutta to renowned writer Sukumar Ray who was prominent in the field
        of arts and literature. Starting his career as a commercial artist, he
        was drawn into independent filmmaking after meeting French filmmaker
        Jean Renoir and viewing Vittorio De Sica's Italian neorealist film
        Bicycle Thieves (1948) during a visit to London. Ray directed 36 films,
        including feature films, documentaries and shorts and authored several
        short stories and novels, primarily for young children and teenagers.
        Feluda, the sleuth, and Professor Shonku, the scientist in his science
        fiction stories, Tarini Khuro, the storyteller and Lalmohan Ganguly, the
        novelist are popular fictional characters created by him. In 1978, he
        was awarded an honorary degree by Oxford University. Ray's first film,
        Pather Panchali (1955), won eleven international prizes, including the
        inaugural Best Human Document award at the 1956 Cannes Film Festival.
        This film, along with Aparajito (1956) and Apur Sansar (The World of
        Apu) (1959), form The Apu Trilogy. Ray did the scripting, casting,
        scoring, and editing, and designed his own credit titles and publicity
        material. Ray received many major awards in his career, including 36
        Indian National Film Awards, a Golden Lion, a Golden Bear, 2 Silver
        Bears, many additional awards at international film festivals and
        ceremonies, and an Academy Honorary Award in 1992. The Government of
        India honoured him with the Bharat Ratna, its highest civilian award, in
        1992. Ray had received many notable awards during his lifetime.
