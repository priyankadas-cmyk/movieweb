      <p>
        A film director's task is to envisage a way to translate a screenplay
        into a fully formed film, and then to realize this vision.[4] To do
        this, they oversee the artistic and technical elements of film
        production.[3][5] This entails organizing the film crew in such a way to
        achieve their vision of the film and communicating with the
        actors.[6][7] This requires skills of group leadership, as well as the
        ability to maintain a singular focus even in the stressful, fast-paced
        environment of a film set.[8] Moreover, it is necessary to have an
        artistic eye to frame shots and to give precise feedback to cast and
        crew,[9] thus, excellent communication skills are a must.[10] Because
        the film director depends on the successful cooperation of many
        different creative individuals with possibly strongly contradicting
        artistic ideals and visions, he or she also needs to possess
        conflict-resolution skills to mediate whenever necessary.[11] Thus the
        director ensures that all individuals involved in the film production
        are working towards an identical vision for the completed film.[6] The
        set of varying challenges he or she has to tackle has been described as
        "a multi-dimensional jigsaw puzzle with egos and weather thrown in for
        good measure".[12] It adds to the pressure that the success of a film
        can influence when and how they will work again, if at all.[13]
        Generally, the sole superiors of the director are the producers and the
        studio that is financing the film, although sometimes the director can
        also be a producer of the same film.[4][14] The role of a director
        differs from producers in that producers typically manage the logistics
        and business operations of the production, whereas the director is
        tasked with making creative decisions. The director must work within the
        restrictions of the film's budget[15] and the demands of the producer
        and studio (such as the need to get a particular age rating).[16]
        Directors also play an important role in post-production. While the film
        is still in production, the director sends "dailies" to the film editor
        and explains his or her overall vision for the film, allowing the editor
        to assemble an editor's cut. In post-production, the director works with
        the editor to edit the material into the director's cut.
        Well-established directors have the "final cut privilege", meaning that
        they have the final say on which edit of the film is released. For other
        directors, the studio can order further edits without the director's
        permission. The director is one of the few positions that requires
        intimate involvement during every stage of film production. Thus, the
        position of film director is widely considered to be a highly stressful
        and demanding one.[17] It has been said that "20-hour days are not
        unusual".[4] Some directors also take on additional roles, such as
        producing, writing or editing. Under European Union law, the film
        director is considered the "author" or one of the authors of a film,
        largely as a result of the influence of auteur theory.[2] Auteur theory
        is a film criticism concept that holds that a film director's film
        reflects the director's personal creative vision, as if they were the
        primary "auteur" (the French word for "author").[18] In spite of—and
        sometimes even because of—the production of the film as part of an
        industrial process, the auteur's creative voice is distinct enough to
        shine through studio interference and the collective process.
