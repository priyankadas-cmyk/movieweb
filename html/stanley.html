        Stanley Kubrick (/ˈkuːbrɪk/; July 26, 1928 – March 7, 1999) was an
        American film director, producer, screenwriter, and photographer. He is
        frequently cited as one of the greatest filmmakers in cinematic history.
        His films, which are mostly adaptations of novels or short stories,
        cover a wide range of genres, and are noted for their realism, dark
        humor, unique cinematography, extensive set designs, and evocative use
        of music. Kubrick was raised in the Bronx, New York City, and attended
        William Howard Taft High School from 1941 to 1945. He received average
        grades, but displayed a keen interest in literature, photography, and
        film from a young age, and taught himself all aspects of film production
        and directing after graduating from high school. After working as a
        photographer for Look magazine in the late 1940s and early 1950s, he
        began making short films on a shoestring budget, and made his first
        major Hollywood film, The Killing, for United Artists in 1956. This was
        followed by two collaborations with Kirk Douglas: the war picture Paths
        of Glory (1957) and the historical epic Spartacus (1960). Creative
        differences arising from his work with Douglas and the film studios, a
        dislike of the Hollywood industry, and a growing concern about crime in
        America prompted Kubrick to move to the United Kingdom in 1961, where he
        spent most of his remaining life and career. His home at Childwickbury
        Manor in Hertfordshire, which he shared with his wife Christiane, became
        his workplace, where he did his writing, research, editing, and
        management of production details. This allowed him to have almost
        complete artistic control over his films, but with the rare advantage of
        having financial support from major Hollywood studios. His first
        productions in Britain were two films with Peter Sellers, Lolita (1962)
        and Dr. Strangelove (1964). A demanding perfectionist, Kubrick assumed
        control over most aspects of the filmmaking process, from direction and
        writing to editing, and took painstaking care with researching his films
        and staging scenes, working in close coordination with his actors and
        other collaborators. He often asked for several dozen retakes of the
        same shot in a movie, which resulted in many conflicts with his casts.
        Despite the resulting notoriety among actors, many of Kubrick's films
        broke new ground in cinematography. The scientific realism and
        innovative special effects of 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) were without
        precedent in the history of cinema, and the film earned him his only
        personal Oscar, for Best Visual Effects. Steven Spielberg has referred
        to the film as his generation's "big bang"; it is regarded as one of the
        greatest films ever made. For the 18th-century period film Barry Lyndon
        (1975), Kubrick obtained lenses developed by Zeiss for NASA, to film
        scenes under natural candlelight. With The Shining (1980), he became one
        of the first directors to make use of a Steadicam for stabilized and
        fluid tracking shots. While many of Kubrick's films were controversial
        and initially received mixed reviews upon release—particularly A
        Clockwork Orange (1971), which Kubrick pulled from circulation in the UK
        following a mass media frenzy—most were nominated for Oscars, Golden
        Globes, or BAFTA Awards, and underwent critical reevaluations. His last
        film, Eyes Wide Shut, was completed shortly before his death in 1999 at
        the age of 70.
