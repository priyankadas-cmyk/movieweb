        About Foreign Cinema
      </h3>
      <p>
        The narrative and visual style of classical Hollywood style developed
        further after the transition to sound-film production. The primary
        changes in American filmmaking came from the film industry itself, with
        the height of the studio system. This mode of production, with its
        reigning star system promoted by several key studios,[13] had preceded
        sound by several years. By mid-1920, most of the prominent American
        directors and actors, who had worked independently since the early
        1910s, had to become a part of the new studio system to continue to
        work. The beginning of the sound era itself is ambiguously defined. To
        some, it began with The Jazz Singer, which was released in 1927, and
        increased box-office profits for films as sound was introduced to
        feature films.[14] To others, the era began in 1929, when the silent age
        had definitively ended.[15] Most Hollywood pictures from the late 1920s
        to 1960s adhered closely to a genre – Western, slapstick comedy,
        musical, animated cartoon, and biopic (biographical picture) – and the
        same creative teams often worked on films made by the same studio. For
        instance, Cedric Gibbons and Herbert Stothart always worked on MGM
        films; Alfred Newman worked at 20th Century Fox for twenty years; Cecil
        B. DeMille's films were almost all made at Paramount Pictures;[16] and
        director Henry King's films were mostly made for Twentieth Century Fox.
        Similarly, actors were mostly contract players. Film historians and
        critics note that it took about a decade for films to adapt to sound and
        return to the level of artistic quality of the silents, which it did in
        the late 1930s. Many great works of cinema that emerged from this period
        were of highly regimented filmmaking. One reason this was possible is
        that, with so many films being made, not every one had to be a big hit.
        A studio could gamble on a medium-budget feature with a good script and
        relatively unknown actors. This was the case with Citizen Kane (1941),
        directed by Orson Welles and regarded by some as the greatest film of
        all time. Other strong-willed directors, like Howard Hawks, Alfred
        Hitchcock and Frank Capra, battled the studios in order to achieve their
        artistic visions. The apogee of the studio system may have been the year
        1939, which saw the release of such classics as Gone with the Wind, The
        Wizard of Oz, The Hunchback of Notre Dame, Stagecoach, Mr. Smith Goes to
        Washington, Destry Rides Again, Young Mr. Lincoln, Wuthering Heights,
        Only Angels Have Wings, Ninotchka, Beau Geste, Babes in Arms, Gunga Din,
        The Women, Goodbye, Mr. Chips, and The Roaring Twenties.[17]
