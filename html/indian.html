      <p>
        The cinema of India consists of films produced in the nation of
        India.[8] Cinema is immensely popular in India. Every year more than
        1800 films get produced collectively in various languages in
        India.[9][10][11] Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata, Hyderabad, Kochi, Bangalore,
        Bhubaneshwar-Cuttack and Guwahati are the major centres of film
        production in India.[details 1] As of 2013, India ranked first in terms
        of annual film output, followed by Nigeria,[10][31] Hollywood and
        China.[32] In 2012, India produced 1,602 feature films.[10] The Indian
        film industry reached overall revenues of $1.86 billion (₹93 billion) in
        2011. In 2015, India had a total box office gross of US$2.1
        billion,[6][33] the third largest in the world. In 2011, Indian cinema
        sold over 3.5 billion tickets worldwide, 900,000 more than Hollywood.
        The overall revenue of Indian cinema reached US$2.7 billion in 2019.[34]
        The industry is segmented by language. In 2019, the Hindi film industry
        represented 44% of box office revenue followed by the Telugu film
        industry and Tamil film industry representing 13% of the box office
        revenue each and Malayalam film industry and Kannada film industry
        representing 5% each - the top 5 film industries of the nation in terms
        of revenue as of 2019.[35] Other prominent film industries include
        Bengali, Marathi and Punjabi cinemas. By 2020, the combined box office
        revenue of regional film industries has surpassed the box office revenue
        of Hindi film industry with over 47% of Indian box office revenue, while
        Hindi cinema had represented 40% of Indian box office revenue.[34]
        Bengali cinema was largely associated with the parallel cinema movement,
        in contrast to the masala films more prominent in Bollywood and Southern
        films at the time. Indian cinema is a global enterprise.[36] Its films
        have a following throughout Southern Asia and across Europe, North
        America, Asia, the Greater Middle East, Eastern Africa, China and
        elsewhere, reaching in over 90 countries.[37]Films like Bahubali: The
        beginning made on a budget of Rupees 180 crores was dubbed in more than
        three languages. It broke the box office records with a domestic
        collection of Rupees 650 crores. Millions of Indians overseas watch
        Indian films, accounting for some 12% of revenues.[38] Music rights
        alone account for 4–5% of net revenues.[39] Global enterprises such as
        Universal Pictures, 20th Century Fox, Sony Pictures, Walt Disney
        Pictures[40][41] and Warner Bros. invested in the industry along with
        Indian enterprises such as AVM Productions, Prasad's Group, Sun
        Pictures, AGS Entertainment, Mercury 2, Geetha Arts, Zee, UTV, Suresh
        Productions, Eros International, Ayngaran International, Pyramid
        Saimira, Aascar Films and Adlabs. By 2003 as many as 30 film production
        companies had been listed in the National Stock Exchange of India
        (NSE).[42]
