            Telling stories with shadows puppets have always been around but itâ€™s
            the magic lantern shows that started in the 1600s that were crucial to
            the birth of cinema. Pictures painted on glass were projected by a
            lantern (just a candle and a lens) onto the wall. This lantern was an
            early version of todayâ€™s projectors. From the 1830s onwards, more and
            more people were finding ways to make still images appear to be
            moving. They all used the scientific concept of â€œpersistence of
            visionâ€œ. This just means that the eye takes a certain amount of time
            to see, so if images flash in front of our eyes before they have the
            chance to properly see them, it appears as though they are in motion.
